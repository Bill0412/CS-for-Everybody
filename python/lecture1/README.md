## Lecture Overview
Following is a brief of what we learned in this class.
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) on your PC
- Write Your First Program with Python IDLE(bundled in Python installation package)
- Bit-wise operations: `^`(exclusive or), `|`(or), `&`(and)
- A glance at function callstack: the [add function](add.py) and modern debugger(VSCode pdb extension)

## Homework
You should finish the homework in a week's time, but since it's the first week, we will push off all the ddls before 20210501 to 20210505.(Please hand in this homework with)

1. Reading the following chapters of the book Python for Everybody and discuss what your have learnt and what you are confused about on next lesson.
    - Chapter 1: Why should you learn to write programs
    - Chapter 2: Variables, expressions, and statements 
    - Chpater 4: Functions

2. HackerRank Programming:
    - [Say "Hello, World!" With Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/py-hello-world/problem)
    - [Arithmetic Operators](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-arithmetic-operators/problem)
    - [Python: Division](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-division/problem)
    - [Write a function](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/write-a-function/problem)


3. (Optional but Highly Recommended) Learn lectures of MIT 6.0001 by yourself. The material won't be covered in this course but is a good complementary for this course.

4. (Optional) The `add.py` we wrote on class is in this directory, but furthermore, there is a `add.cpp` program as well, which is writen in C++. You may try to find the difference between them.

Hint: in pure C, you have to overload functions to have the same functionality as the python add. In C++ you can use the function template, then how about the complexity of the syntax?
